# Hardhat

## Hardhat Development Environment

[`Hardhat`](https://hardhat.org/) is a development environment for Ethereum software

Flexible JavaScript based development environment to copile, deploy, test adn debug EVM based smart contracts.

Enables easy integration of code and external tools

Local Hardhat etwork to simulate Ethereum

Extensible plygin features

High level of debugging features

## Hardhat Setup

to [`install hardhat`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#installation), run the command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

To [`create the sample project`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#installation), run the command:

```bash
npx hardhat init
```

to access to hardhat [`global options or availabel tasks`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#running-tasks) run the the command:

```bash
npx hardhat
```

## Deploying SimpleStorage from Hardhat

to compile our contract we run the command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

> rememeber to match the version of your contract with the version in `hardhat.config.js` file

Some contracts need to be linked with libraries before they are deployed. You can pass the addresses of their libraries to the [`getContractFactory`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-ethers#library-linking) function with an object like this

```js
const { ethers } = require('hardhat');

const SimpleStorageFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('SimpleStorage');
```

and then you can use the deploy method to deploy it.

```js
const SimpleStorageFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('SimpleStorage');
const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorageFactory.deploy();
```

to get the address of the deployed contract there are two ways

```js
await simpleStorage.getAddress();
simpleStorage.target;
```

the command to execute the js file to deploy is:

```bash
npx hardhat run [pathOfTheJSFile]
```

## Networks in Hardhat

Hardhat comes [`built-in with Hardhat Network`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview), a local Ethereum network node designed for development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code, all within the confines of your local machine.

you can also change the default network in `hardhat.config.js` file

```js
module.exports = {
	defaultNetwork: 'hardhat',
};
```

we can also add other networks like `Sepolia`, `Rinkeby`, `localhost`, ....
you need to pass `url`, `accounts` which is an `array of privateKeys` and `chainId` properties.

for example for sepolia testnet, we can take the `url from alchemy`, `privateKey from metamask` and [`chainId from chainlist.org`](https://chainlist.org/)

```js
module.exports = {
	networks: {
		sepolia: {
			url: 'sepolia testnet url',
			accounts: [privateKey1, privateKey2],
			chainId: 11155111, // chainId for sepolia
		},
	},
};
```

to test in sepolia testnet, we run

```bash
npx hardhat run [pathOfTheJSFile] --network sepolia

//example

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

## Programmatic Verification

the is a plugin in hardhat called [`hardhat-verify`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify) that helps you verify your contract programatically.

command to install the plugin

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify
```

then import the plugin in your `hatdhat.config.js` file

```js
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify');
```

when we import a plugin in `hardhat.config.js`, if the plugin has some tasks, they will be added automatically to hardhat tasks.

`hardhat-verify` plugin adds a task called `verify` to hardhat tasks.

since the plugin uses `etherscan` to verify our contract, so we need ad API key from etherscan, and add it to `hardhat.config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
	etherscan: {
		apiKey: ETHERSCAN_API_KEY,
	},
};
```

> we can run any tasks of hardhat using `run` package

```js
const { run } = require('hardhat');
await run('verify:verify', {
	// the second verify is the parameter you pass to the verify task function
	address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
	constructorArguments: CONSTRUCTOR_ARGUMENTS,
}); // calls the verify task and returns a promise
```

## Interacting with Contracts in Hardhat

we can intract with our contract after contract factory and deploy it

```js
const SimpleStorageFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('SimpleStorage');
const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorageFactory.deploy();

// intract with the contract
const currentValue = await simpleStorage.retrieve();
const transacitonResponse = await simpleStorage.store(42);
```

## Custom Hardhat Tasks

hardhat comes with some tasks, and they can be extended by us writing plugins.

there is a method called [`task`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/create-task) that is imported from `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`

```js
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox');

// the first argument is the name of the task and the second one is the description of it.
task('block-number', 'Prints the current block number').setAction(async (taskArgs, hre) => {
	const blockNumber = await hre.ethers.provider.getBlockNumber();
	console.log(`Current block number: ${blockNumber}`);
});
```

> `setAction` method difines what the task should actually do.

> `hre` => an object containing all the functionality that Hardhat exposes when running a task, test or script. In reality, Hardhat is the HRE. [`hardhat runtime environment`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/hardhat-runtime-environment)

when you declare your task you need to add it to `hardhat.config.js` file.
all you need to do is to import it to`hardhat.config.js` file. it will it will automatically added to hardhat tasks.

```js
require('pathOfTheTaskFile');

//example

require('./tasks/block-number');
```

```bash
npx hardhat nameOfTheTask

//example

npx hardhat block-number

//or (if you want to change the network)

npx hardhat block-nmber --network sepolia
```

## Hardhat Localhost Node

every time we run the script, the hardhat network is deleted, you can't intract with smart contract

but there is a way for us to run a [hardhard network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview).

by typing this script on the terminal, it will spin off the node on the local network exactly the same as gnachat but in our terminal, and it will start a HTTP WebSocket JSON-RPC at a url

```bash
yarn hardhat node
```

and then in another terminal, we can run the script to connect to the local host and know about the smart conract

```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

you can quickly testing and working with things on the local javascript vm or hardhat network, we are able to see how your smart contarct will intract on the real test net.

to config your `hardhat.config.js`:

```js
module.export = {
	networks: {
		localhost: {
			url: 'http://127.0.0.1:8545/', // the given url by inserting 'hardhat yarn node' in terminal
			chainId: 31337, // the chain id of the local network is the same as hardhat
			// acounts is not needed because the localhost gives us the accounts
		},
	},
};
```

## Hardhat Localhost Node

Hardhat comes built-in with an interactive JavaScript console. You can use it by running [`hardhat console`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/hardhat-console)

```bash
yarn hardhat console

yarn hardhat console --network sepolia
```

## Running Tests

After compiling your contracts, the next step is to write some tests to verify that they work as intended.

hardhat uses mocha and chai testing libraries underhood. (it is like vitest library in react)

you need to install some packages

[`test contracts`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-chai-matchers)

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers chai@4 @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers
```

you can run the test by typing the following command. to test all 'it's

```bash
yarn hardhat test
```

if you want to test a specific 'it' you can type the following command

```bash
yarn hardhat test --grep [PartOfNameOfTheItTest]

yarn hardhat test --grep store
```

## Hardhat Gas Reporter

we can test to see how much gas each one of our functions actually cost.

one of the extenstion is [`hardhat-gas-reporter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-gas-reporter)

you can install it by typing the following command

```bash
npm i hardhat-gas-reporter --dev
```

and in hardhat-config.js file you can config it.

```js
require('hardhat-gas-reporter');

module.export = {
	gasReporter: {
		enabled: true, // to show the gas reporter in your terminal
		outputFile: 'gas-reporter.txt', // to output the gas reporter in to a .txt file
		noColors: true,
		currency: 'USD',
		coinmarketcap: COINMARKEYCAP_API_KEY, // the API given from https://coinmarketcap.com
		token: 'MATIC', // to deploy in diffrent network
	},
};
```

when you test the contract, it will show you how much gas each one of the function cost. in your terminal

# Solidity Test Coverage

To make sure every line of our .sol file is tested, we can use solidity test coverage. one of the tools for test coverage is [solidity-coverage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solidity-coverage).

we can install it by typing the following command

```bash
npm i solidity-coverage --dev
```

in hardhat-config.js file you can config it.

and test the coverage typing the following command

```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```

# Hardhat Waffle
